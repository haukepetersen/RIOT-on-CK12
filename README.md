# RIOT-on-CK12
Material, documentation, and progress of porting RIOT to the CK12 smartwatch


## Background
The CK12 is a one-of-many smartwatch based on Nordics nRF52832 micro-controller, providing interesting features like BLE, ECG heart rate monitoring, a Bosch BMA253 accelerometer, and a black-and-white OLED screen.

Due to its mechanical 'openness' (screws only, no glue), it promises to be a very nice playground for experimentation and other projects.

Our goal is to port [RIOT](http://www.github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT) to the CK12


## Progress
06/20/2019 - just started


## Special Thanks
- Curt (@curtpw) provides some basic information on the used sensor devices and pin layout in his [nRF5x-device-reverse-engineering](https://github.com/curtpw/nRF5x-device-reverse-engineering) repo, nice job!
